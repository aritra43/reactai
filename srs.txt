## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. PROJECT BACKGROUND, BUSINESS CONTEXT, AND PURPOSE

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, there is an increasing emphasis on digitizing user journeys to optimize cost-efficiency, save time, and enhance convenience for consumers. Technological advancements have enabled the digitalization of consumer interactions that were previously considered unimaginable. A prime example of this is the surge in popularity of retail grocery shopping through online platforms. These advancements have significantly simplified daily life, particularly for individuals with physical conditions due to diseases or age. Yet, it has been observed that the digitalization of patients needing healthcare is limited in terms of outreach and services.

Hence, this app has been designed to improve the reach of the small to medium size healthcare providers to patients. Often, owing to high expenses such healthcare providers shy away from establishing a digital journey, for their clients. Hence, they have a limited customer base and a high churn ratio. This app, hosted on a multi-tenant cloud environment, will help these healthcare providers improve their market share through outreach and customer satisfaction.

This app has simple yet high user experience journeys designed for patients. With minimal clicks and assistance patients can walk through this app with least hindrance. They can manage their health consultations from past and present at one site with features such as return visit scheduling, rescheduling, digital prescriptions and teleconsultations.

Initially this app would provide out-patient services such as appointment booking and management. However, the framework will allow faster addition of newer services and more stakeholder journeys.

Each healthcare provider would have their own app with their data separate from other providers in a multi-tenant SAAS environment.
The plan is to cover 80% of the SME in the healthcare provider market of any metropolitan city.

### 1.2. NEED FOR THE INITIATIVE AND EXPECTED IMPACT

This application is designed to bridge the gap by enhancing the accessibility of small to medium-sized healthcare providers to patients. Many of these providers are deterred by the high costs associated with establishing a comprehensive digital infrastructure for their clients. Consequently, their customer base is often limited, and they experience a high rate of customer turnover. By hosting this application on a multi-tenant cloud environment, healthcare providers can improve their market share through outreach and customer satisfaction.

This application offers a user-friendly experience for patients, characterized by simple navigation and minimal interaction steps. Patients can efficiently manage their health consultations, both past and present, in one centralized location. Features such as return visit scheduling, appointment rescheduling, digital prescriptions, and teleconsultations are integrated to streamline the patient experience. By offering these features, the application aims to improve patient engagement, reduce administrative burden, and enhance overall healthcare outcomes.

*   **Medical Data:**
    *   **ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision):** Used for classifying and coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures.
        *   **Example:** "I10" represents essential (primary) hypertension.
    *   **SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms):** A comprehensive clinical healthcare terminology that provides a consistent way to represent clinical information.
        *   **Example:** "225328004" represents the concept of "Headache".
    *   **RxNorm:** A standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs.
        *   **Example:** "1191" represents the drug "Aspirin".

*   **Appointment Types:**
    *   **Scheme:** A controlled vocabulary for classifying appointment types.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   "CONS" - Consultation
            *   "FUP" - Follow-up
            *   "TELC" - Teleconsultation
            *   "EMER" - Emergency

*   **User Roles:**
    *   **Scheme:** A controlled vocabulary for classifying user roles within the application.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   "GUEST" - Guest User
            *   "PATIENT" - Registered Patient
            *   "STAFF" - Healthcare Staff
            *   "DOCTOR" - Doctor

*   **Versioning Strategies:**
    *   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** A versioning scheme that uses a three-part version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
        *   **Example:** "1.2.3"
    *   **Hierarchical Naming Methods:**
        *   **Example:**
            *   "PATIENT_EHR_ID"
            *   "APPT_WEB_ID"

**Real-world example:**

Consider a scenario where a doctor diagnoses a patient with hypertension. Using the ICD-10 code "I10", the doctor can accurately and consistently represent the diagnosis in the patient's medical record.

## 10. DEPENDENCIES

The healthcare application relies on several internal and external dependencies to function properly.

*   **Internal Dependencies:**
    *   **Authentication Service:**
        *   Potential Bottleneck: High concurrent login requests.
        *   Failure Point: Service failure prevents logins.
        *   Contingency Planning: Redundant service with failover.
    *   **Database Management System (DBMS):**
        *   Potential Bottleneck: Poor optimization or high query load.
        *   Failure Point: DBMS failure prevents data access.
        *   Contingency Planning: Redundant DBMS with failover and backups.

*   **External Dependencies:**
    *   **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems:**
        *   Third-Party Service: Availability and reliability of EHR systems.
        *   API: Communication with EHR systems via APIs.
        *   Regulatory Constraint: Compliance with HIPAA and other regulations.
        *   Potential Bottleneck: Overload of EHR systems
        *   Failure Point: unavailability of the system, the application will be unable to access or update patient medical records.
        *    Contingency Planning: Implementing caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data.

    *   **Payment Gateways:**
        *   Third-Party Service: Availability and reliability of payment gateways.
        *   API: Communication with payment gateways via APIs.
        *   Regulatory Constraint: Compliance with PCI DSS and other regulations.
         *   Potential Bottleneck: Overload of the system
        *   Failure Point: If the payment gateways are unavailable, users will be unable to make online payments.
        *    Contingency Planning: Implement multiple payment gateways and provide a fallback mechanism.

**Risk Assessments and Mitigation Strategies:**

| Dependency                | Risk                                                         | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EHR Systems               | Data breaches, system downtime, API changes                  | Implement strong security measures, monitor system performance, establish SLAs with EHR vendors, use adaptable API integration strategies                       |
| Payment Gateways          | Transaction failures, security breaches, compliance violations | Use reputable gateways, implement fraud detection, comply with PCI DSS, have backup payment methods                                                        |
| Authentication Service    | Account lockouts, service outages                           | Implement MFA, use a highly available service, have monitoring and alerting in place                                                                       |
| Database Management System | Data loss, performance degradation                          | Implement regular backups, use replication and failover mechanisms, optimize database queries and indexing, implement data encryption at rest and in transit |

**Real-world example:**

Consider a scenario where the EHR system is unavailable due to a system outage. The healthcare application should be able to detect this outage and provide a fallback mechanism, such as displaying cached data or allowing users to schedule appointments without accessing medical records. Similarly, if the payment gateway is unavailable, the application should provide an alternative payment method or allow users to pay in person.

**Industry Best Practices:**

*   Identify and Document Dependencies.
*   Assess Risks.
*   Develop Mitigation Strategies.
*   Monitor Dependencies.
*   Establish SLAs.
*   Implement Redundancy and Failover.
